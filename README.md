### Math 22 Final Projects!

<ins>Math 22A Final: Methods of Rotation in Computer Graphics</ins>: Explore the dynamic world of rotation with this comprehensive project that delves into three distinct methods: rotation using a 3 × 3 matrix, Euler Angles, and Quaternions. The project begins by demystifying the concept of 3 × 3 matrix rotations, providing a clear example of rotating around the x-axis. Moving on, the focus shifts to Euler Angles, offering insights into both practical applications and potential pitfalls like Gimbal Lock. The project then unfolds the fascinating realm of Quaternions, visualizing their intricacies and demonstrating various Quaternion operations. With a structured approach, this project is an illuminating journey through essential concepts and practical examples in the domain of rotational transformations.
